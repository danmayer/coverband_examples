coverband_examples
==================

Small Ruby (non Rails or Rack) examples of using coverband

This was in response to a [issue filed with coverband](https://github.com/danmayer/coverband/issues/19). It was easier to answer with this small example. In the future I can add additional coverband examples to this repo, to show various use cases and solutions to common problems.

If you have any questions please file issues with the coverband repo, and I may answer with a new example in this repo.

Thanks
